This repository holds the code for my project.
To start my web applications clone the repository and execute *server_map.py* and *server_bubble.py*.
Then navigate to to your webbrowser and find the chloropleth map and the bubble chart running on *http://127.0.0.1:5001*
and *http://127.0.0.1:5000* respectively.
